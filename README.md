## How to run
You will need Flask along with a version of python installed

To run a test version of your code on a local host, first navigate to the src folder in your respective terminal. Then run 'python3 app.py' or another version of python and open the local address on chrome. (Normally http://127.0.0.1:5500/)
If you need to install or update any dependencies, just follow what your computer recommends after failing the host.
